A basketball bounces rhythmically on a court, shoes squeak against the floor, and a referee’s whistle cuts through the air.
A train conductor blows a sharp whistle, metal wheels screech on the rails, and passengers murmur while settling into their seats
Melodic human whistling harmonizing with natural birdsong
Rhythmic wooden table tapping overlaid with steady water pouring sound
Dripping water echoes sharply, a distant growl reverberates through the cavern, and soft scraping metal suggests something lurking unseen.
